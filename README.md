In this new world of technology, with the security of online transactions and applications becoming more and more difficult, voting needs to be more secure and accessible. With growing news of tampering of votes, new infrastructure needs to be created. For the same, we propose to create an application that works on all platforms like android, ios, etc. and caters to every need of the voters. The app will have the following features:
*	Login: If the user has already registered using his voter ID and has been provided with a public key, he/she can log in. To log in, the user needs his/her voter ID number and the public key provided at the time of registration.
*	Registration: If the user is not registered, he can request for registration. This will be an offline process, where the user will be authenticated by biometric verification, and the documents of the user will be verified by an official agency. The user will be provided with the public key. The user should have a voter ID for the registration.
*	Request Voter ID: If the user does not possess a voter ID, he can request for the same. He will be redirected to the official page of the government where he can then fill the necessary forms.
Once the user is logged in, he/she will have access to the following features:
*	Candidatesâ€™ Info: Info of each political party and all their candidates will be displayed in detail. It will contain information of every candidate, such as education details, his/her political agendas, previous election results(if any), criminal records, past attendance in the house(If applicable), etc.
*	Voting: The voting will be open for a fixed period. Whenever the user decides to vote, he/she will be provided with a token which will be valid for a fixed period. Once the user has completed voting, the token will be rendered invalid immediately. If the user does not vote in the allotted period, he/she will be blocked for voting for a certain time(say 8 hours). Only after the blocking period is over, will he/she be able to vote.
*	Results: The user will be notified when the results of the elections are out. Also, the user will be able to see statistical information like votes were given, percentages of votes acquired by different parties regions, etc. 

We will use azure blockchain to ensure that the voting count remains secure and unchangeable by unfair means. This will solve the following problems:
* Tampering of votes by forceful and unlawful means. As the token is valid only for a time, and the user gets blocked if the vote is not given in that time.
* Low turnout of voters will not be a problem anymore as this process is easy, fast, and convenient.
*	A registered user does not have to be present in that region to vote. And hence can vote from anywhere in the world provided he/she has internet access.
